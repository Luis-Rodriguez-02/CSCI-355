    <p>
      We make ourselves a place apart<br />
      &nbsp;Behind the light words that tease and flout,<br />But oh, the
      agitated heart<br />&nbsp;Till someone find us really out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis pity if the case require<br />&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end<br />
      We speak the literal to inspire<br />&nbsp;The understanding of a freind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so with all, from babes that play<br />&nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God,
      afar, So all hwo hide too well away<br />&nbsp;Must speak and tell us
      there they are.
